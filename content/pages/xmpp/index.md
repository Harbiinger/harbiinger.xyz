First, you will need to choose a name for your account and send it to me so I can create an account on the XMPP instance for you (only administrators are allowed to create accounts). 
I will then send you your ID and password (which you can change later on). 
From there on, you should be able to connect to the instance using the provided ID and password. 
To connect, you must use a client (either on Windows/Linux/MacOS or Android/iOS). 
A great client for Android is Monocles Chat which you can download from [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/) (free application store for open source apps ). 
If you use another client, please make sure it supports OMEMO encryption.
